If you don't have a public domain name like research.brickred.com, you may still try this application with your local system configuration. For that:<br><br>
1.	Open C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts file (in notepad) and add following entry:
127.0.0.1	research.brickred.com
(There is a Tab in between)
