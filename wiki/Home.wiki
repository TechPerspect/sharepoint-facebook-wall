= What is !SharePoint Facebook? = 

Have you ever needed to show the facebook updates of your organization on your sharepoint portal ? If yes, this project is for you.

What we provide is four webparts for !SharePoint 2007 & !SharePoint 2010. 
 # First that can be used to show the facebook wall of any user on the !SharePoint portal. 
 # Second webpart can be used to post updates to facebook directly from your sharepoint portal. 
 # Third webpart, the Like Box, is a social plugin that enables Facebook Page owners to attract and gain Likes from their own website. The Like Box enables users to see how many users already like this Page, and which of their friends like it too. 
 # Fourth webpart, the Like button, lets a user share your content with friends on Facebook. When the user clicks the Like button on your site, a story appears in the user's friends' News Feed with a link back to your website.

Just download and install, and you are all set. 

The only thing you need to configure after installation is the username of the facebook user whose updates you want to show. For posting to facebook, slightly more configuration is needed - you need to register a facebook application and get the OAuth settings. This web parts use out of the box !SharePoint CSS elements that match automatically with current theme.
